        <p>Hi! My name is Natalie Umana. I was named after an Italian song named Natalie. I was born and raised in Boston but my family comes from El Salvador. Because my family is Hispanic the first language I learned to read and write is Spanish. My parents didn't know much English therefore I taught myself English by watching Barney. I currently live in East Boston with my parents, younger and only sister, my two dogs, my turtle, and a bird. As much as I am embarassed to admit it, I spend most of my time at home with my dogs than I do with people.</p>
        <p2>After high school I wasn't sure what I wanted to study in college so I decided to take a year to figure out what I wanted to do. During that year, I went to a technical school to become a massage therapist. That didn't work out, so I decided to take some courses in community college. At that time that I couldn't apply myself to my studies as I should've so as a random act of courage I decided to join the Army. Joining the Army was one of the best decisions I've made beacuse I learned a lot of values there that I will always apply to my day to day life. I also met amazing people that will always have a special part in my life. I was in the Army for four years and my job title was 68Q, pharmacy tech. Before joining I thought I wanted to pursue a career as a pharmacist but after dealing with medicine I realized that was not for me. Since leaving the Army I have been pursuing becoming a social worker because I love to help people, and would love to work with people with mental health and addictions. I have always been interested in coding and learning how to do my own websites. Now, I am very happy to be in this program but also very nervous!</p2>
